# cortex-demo01

This is a skeleton project intended for use in a class when teaching the basic first steps of building a cortex based PROS code project.  Students should clone this project to their local PROS environment, and use it to understand the basic interaction between the driver control (opcontrol.c) and autonomous (auto.c) components of a typical VRC tournament.

Created a branch to demonstrate branch and merge in gitHUB

Added in the opcontrol.c function a sample of both arcade and tank control

This is a FORKED copy of the original Repo
